## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Modern static site builder
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - UI component library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type-safe JavaScript

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aabdoo23/portfolio
cd portfolio
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY = YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
```
4. Access the `userconfig.ts` file and start putting in your data.

5. To generate json files for your projects, I have provided a `github_repo_parser.py` file in the `util` folder, you can provide a github token to avoid rate limiting to the call of the parser in the main
```python
def main():
    parser = GitHubRepoParser('ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE')
    
```

## 🚀 Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:4321`.

## 🏗️ Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploy to vercel:
```bash
npx vercel deploy --prod
```
or 
```bash
npx vercel deploy
```
and select the image from the vercel dashboard.

There is a bug with direct deployment from github, i can't seem to figure it out tbf, so for the time being use the above commands after running ```npm run build```.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
